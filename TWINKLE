Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are!
Up above the world so high,
Like a diamond in the sky.
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are!

ASHFIQUA
Twinkle twinkle little star
Shining brightly and afar
Twinkle star dust all around
From the sky right to the ground

RISVANA
Twinkle twinkle little star
Shining brightly and afar

DILNA 
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are!
Up above the world so high,
Like a diamond in the sky.
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are!
